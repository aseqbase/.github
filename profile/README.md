# 🧬 MiMFa aseqbase

**aseqbase** is a sequence-based web development framework designed by MiMFa to simplify the creation of modular, scalable, and accessible websites. Whether you're building a multi-subdomain platform or a single-page site, aseqbase provides the structure and tools to do it efficiently.

## 🌐 Project Overview

aseqbase is built around the concept of **sequential web architecture**—where each component, page, or subdomain follows a logical, layered sequence for deployment and accessibility. This makes it ideal for:

- Multi-subdomain websites
- Single-page applications
- Custom CMS setups
- Educational or media-rich platforms
